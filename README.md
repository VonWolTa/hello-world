Hi, my name is Wolta.
I'm a programer stundent from Hungary and i'm here because i heard a lot about Github and as i know, if someone want to be a programer nowdays, must have a Github account and practice in it. Actually i like it. It's a very good SCM system, based on what i read here until now. I can't wait for use it.
